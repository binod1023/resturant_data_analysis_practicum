## Overview of the Project
In this project, market data analysis of restaurant business of LA region will be done. The data on this project is collected from open sources. A business team is going to start a new resturant in this area. Through this analysis we are going to find what types of resturant needs to be started in LA region. On this project we will answer some questions which are required to make conclusion on what types of restaurant is needed to be build in this region.  

## Prerequisite  
This project is mainly done in Python using necessary libraries.  

The restuarant data is given withe the following columns  
object_name: establishment name  
chain: chain establishment (TRUE/FALSE)  
object_type: establishment type  
address: address  
number: number of seats

## Decribtion of the Project
At introduction of the project is presented. Then data sets and necessary libraries are imported. On preprocessing step, I cleaned uniformity in names of the street and restaurant establishments. On analysis process, I figured out locations, types, number of seats, and chain/non-chain type of restaurant establishement. By analyzing the restaurant data, I would be determining which streets have less restaurants. Finally, the conclusion will be made on what types of restaurant is needed to be build in which part of the LA region.
